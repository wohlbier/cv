\coverletter{
Please accept my application for the position of Chief Scientist in the
Emerging Technology Center at the Carnegie Mellon University Software
Engineering institute. I think you will find that I am a highly
qualified candidate for the position, and I look forward to discussing
the opportunity with you.

I am presently a Senior Research Scientist in the Emerging
Technology Center at the Carnegie Mellon University
Software Engineering Institute. I started my
postdoctoral career at
Los Alamos
National Laboratory where I spent over a decade working on
computational physics for the US Department of Energy Advanced
Simulation and Computing program. Starting in 2016 I spent
several years supporting DoD HPC programs. In the ETC, I am the technical
lead for the
SEI involvement in the DARPA Software
Defined Hardware and Domain Specific System on Chip programs.
My current technical focus is performance engineering and co-design
for data intensive software, including graph analytics, artificial
intelligence and
machine learning applications.

As my CV demonstrates, I have significant experience performing
and publishing deeply technical research, developing programs, and
have broadly engaged
with the scientific community. Furthermore, I have extensive
experience mentoring graduate and postdoctoral students. I have also
mentored many junior staff members and have been actively involved in
hiring and recruitment. I have served on technical committees that
are tasked with proposal review and curation. I am an exceptional
communicator, and I work easily with a broad spectrum of coworkers and
customers.

I would be thrilled to be considered for the ETC Chief Scientist
position. Please reach out to me at any time to discuss my
qualifications.

Sincerely,\\
