% Summary
\addblocktext{Summary}{%
  Dr.~Wohlbier is a Senior Research Scientist in the Emerging
  Technology Center (ETC) at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
  Software Engineering Institute (SEI). Wohlbier started his
  post-doctoral career at
  Los Alamos
  National Laboratory where he spent over a decade working on
  computational physics for the US Department of Energy Advanced
  Simulation and Computing program. Starting in 2016 Wohlbier spent
  several years supporting DoD HPC programs. Wohlbier leads the
  SEI involvement in the DARPA Software
  Defined Hardware and Domain Specific System on Chip programs. His
  current focus is performance engineering and codesign for data
  intensive
  software. His interests include computation on modern and emerging
  hardware, performance engineering, and computational physics.
