\datedexperience{Los Alamos National Laboratory}{2005 -- 2016}
\explanation{Computational Scientist}
\explanationdetail{{\bf Multi-physics software development for high
    performance computing.} Active on several multi-physics code
  projects for high performance computing for 10 years. Physics
  include but are not limited to compressible hydrodynamics,
  radiation-matter coupling, and magnetohydrodynamics. Activities
  included coding and optimization for Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors and
  NVidia GPUs, and implementation of distributed memory parallel
  domain decomposition and parallel I/O for an unstructured
  tetrahedral mesh code. C++/C/Fortran. MPI/OpenMP/OpenCL/CUDA.\\
  {\bf Project lead for ``Multi-physics on multi-core''.} Lead
  successful effort to develop multi-physics code for the Cell
  processor in the Roadrunner supercomputer era. Roadrunner was a
  radically different heterogeneous architecture that required
  simultaneous use of the three very different types of processors on
  the system. The compute engine on the Cell processor was a short
  vector processor similar to what is emerging in current Intel
  hardware, but had additional barriers to use such as the need to
  specifically issue direct memory accesses (DMA's) to load
  registers.\\
  {\bf Data Science Consultant.} Consulted on several data science
  projects with data science company. Developed {\em R} based
  prediction models using large financial and demographic data
  sets. Name of data science company available upon request.\\
  {\bf Post-doc and graduate student mentor.} Mentored two
  post-doctoral researchers, both of which are now productive and well
  respected staff scientists. Mentored and worked with several
  graduate students pursuing degrees in computational physics.
